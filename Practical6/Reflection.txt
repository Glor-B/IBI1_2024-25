This practical is abit more challenging than previous ones.
For me, comprehensing each function and the logic is not difficult, but it's challenging for me to get used to the way 'python' think.
For example, to deal with probability, we have to use np.random to simulate the production of probability instead of just simply use the probability of one events.

The most challenging part is the spatial SIR. At first it seemed an extremely huge project for me. I was lost in several ideas of how each part can be done and I couldn't find the start.
So I decided to just start by doing each section, for example, first I finish the neighbor_check part (which is later transformed into a function), and slowly I hva a clearer idea of how things should go.
I think it is important to break down a big project into small things. For example, functions help with this because I can write some small functions first before starting the whole loop.

Another thing I realized is that discussing with peer also helps a lot. Not only did I learn their logic, but also by expalning my ideas to others I also become clear about what I should do next.
Without the discussion with others I coudn't have finish spatial SIR so quickly.
