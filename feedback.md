For practical3, I received full marks, so there's nothing to change.

For practical4, the marker commented that I need to use codes to do the comparison in variables.py, so I add that part of script. Also, I forget to contain the truth table in variables.py, so I add it in comment this time. What's more, the marker commented that my explanation is slightly inaccurate in mystery_code.py, so I change the explanation according the marker's advice.

For Practical5, first I correct some typo. Then, following the marker's advice, I directly use the dictionary to plot the cart instead of creating 2 lists first. As for population size sorting, I didn't print the sorted list of populations before, so I add this part this time.
